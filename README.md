# port-distributed-blockchain-network

Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology in which nodes communicate with each other in a cryptographically secure manner. All nodes in the blockchain network have their own copy of the ledger. Consistency is maintained between the nodes using some consensus algorithm. All transactions are verified using digital signature and ledge itself is practically tamper-proof due to the unique hashing machanism of the blockchain.

This Node.js project is an implementation of the Blockchain Technology in a local environment by creating a distributed network among different ports within a system. Run npm start using different port numbers to create a distributed local environment.
